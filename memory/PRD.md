# PROTOCOL_V - Valentine Week Experience for Argha

## Overview
A mysterious, puzzle-driven 8-day Valentine proposal experience designed for Argha—an intelligent Alpha who loves logic puzzles and strategy. Each "Protocol" is a chapter that hides secrets and requires solving puzzles to unlock.

## Key Changes (Latest Update - Emotional Journey Enhancements)
- **Mysterious names**: No more "Rose Day, Teddy Day" → Now cryptic "PROTOCOL_001: ORIGIN", "PROTOCOL_004: GLITCH" etc.
- **Complex puzzles**: Caesar ciphers, pattern recognition, riddles, matching games
- **Hidden Easter Eggs**: 8 secret fragments containing Shivani's poetry about how she sees him
- **New passcode**: 14052024 (the date he proposed!)
- **Photos integrated**: Scotch (dog) in Protocol007, couple photo in Final response
- **Time-lock ready**: Can be enabled to unlock one protocol per day (Feb 7-14)
- **NEW: DayCompletionPage** - Dedicated emotional completion screens after each chapter
- **NEW: Midway Checkpoint** - Emotional pause at /midway-checkpoint after Day 4 before starting "US" chapters
- **NEW: Single "Yes, Forever" button** - ProtocolFinal now has only one affirmative option

## Emotional Journey Flow
1. **Protocols 001-004**: Argha's personal journey (origin, growth, betrayal, the "glitch")
2. **Midway Checkpoint**: An intentional pause - "The next chapters are about US"
3. **Protocols 005-007**: Their relationship story (paradox, anchor, revelation)
4. **Protocol Final**: The proposal with single "Yes, Forever" button

## Protocol Structure

## Hidden Easter Eggs (Poetry Fragments)
Each protocol has a hidden `[HIDDEN_FRAGMENT_00X]` link that reveals a piece of her heart:

1. **Fragment 1**: "The warmth of sunshine couldn't do what his presence did..."
2. **Fragment 2**: "I want him to be my best friend... a love that's real, raw, ridiculous"
3. **Fragment 3**: "I want love that chooses me, even on days I'm hard to love"
4. **Fragment 4**: "Even vodka couldn't do what his black shirt did..."
5. **Fragment 5**: "Strong couples create things to look forward to. Date nights. Slow mornings..."
6. **Fragment 6**: "I want to be his happy wife, soft, radiant, & deeply loved"
7. **Fragment 7**: "I want to be your motivation... my most treasured title: Your Wife"
8. **Fragment Final**: "Close your eyes and think of me... Our love forever as destiny"
